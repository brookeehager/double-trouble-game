# double-trouble-game
This is a game inspired by my life, created for my spring 2021 Python class at Fort Hays State University
The object of the game is to make it to bedtime and get the twins to sleep before your energy runs out. This game utilizes Python methods such as classes, loops, random choice and keeps score for the duration of the game. Good luck!
